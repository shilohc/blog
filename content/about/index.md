Hi, I'm Shiloh!  I'm a robotics hobbyist turned "legitimate" "professional" "engineer", specializing in planning and control.  Still, nobody can prevent me from building ill-advised hobby projects in my free time.  In addition to robot projects, I build mechanical keyboards, knit and crochet, and paint.  Someday, I dream of constructing a supervillain lair and building a robot to toss my enemies into the lava pit.

You can find my professional portfolio [here](https://shilohc.github.io/portfolio/ ) and contact me [here](mailto:shilohc[at]mit[dot]edu ).

MIT SB '20 MEng '21, course 6-2.  I am nonbinary and use they/them pronouns.
