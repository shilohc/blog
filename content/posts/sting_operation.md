Sting Operation is a homebrew telepresence robot; my original intent was to use it to attend [robot club](http://hbrobotics.org/ ) when I'm away at MIT.  Currently, it's outfitted with a Neato BotVac LiDAR, a Raspberry Pi running ROS, and a PyBoard controlling the motors and LIDAR. An iPad mounted on a tripod lets me FaceTime the robot.

Pictured above: Sting Operation base (minus tripod). It's a two-wheeled base with a castor wheel.  There is also a RC receiver that can be used for local teleoperation, and a dial on the front of the robot indicating its state (under remote control, under local control, stopped, etc).
