In [my last post](/posts/design_philosophy_01/) on design, I talked about how asking for unnecessary information about your users on forms (and worse, making it a required field) is highly likely to exclude "edge-case" users.  

Let's just think about that phrasing for a second.  "Edge-case" users.  In one stroke, you've split up your users into "normal people" and "edge cases" and decided that only the "normal people" are worth catering to -- generally, "normal people" are straight, cis, white, male, abled, etc etc.  It's a small act of cruelty that multiplies itself a thousand times over.  

I am used to being considered an edge case.  I am, of course, nonbinary, which fucks up many things, from signup forms for social networks that force you to pick a binary gender to housing policies that require roommates to be of the same gender (even if they respect my identity, what if one of us prefers "agender" and the other "neutrois" or "genderqueer"?  Does that count?).  But even before that, I have been homeschooled my whole life, and it felt like every single person and system I encountered as a kid wanted me to be in a grade.  

My mom would always have to coach me: "Remember, when you're at soccer camp, you're in fifth grade.  When you're at history class, you're in sixth.  When you're at Sunday school, you're in fourth."  The first question people asked me was my name -- the second was invariably my grade.  I got used to lying, making up numbers, or avoiding the question ("I'm twelve years old").  Sometimes I'd lie and say "sixth grade" and the well-meaning adult in question would say "how do you feel about moving up to middle school next year?" and I'd have to keep on lying.  I spun a yarn for a group of fellow summer-camp attendees about having skipped third grade, because I could never remember what age corresponded to what grade and I happened to have gotten the calculation wrong.  Occasionally I'd use my scripted response, "I'm homeschooled, and we don't do grades," and the person I was talking to would break -- "but, like, what grade are you in, though?"  I am still fairly good at lying, a skill that came in handy as a closeted queer teenager, but now I look back on these frustrated childhood experiences and realize that it was, if not an act of violence, certainly not entirely benign that everyone I encountered wanted to put me in a box where I decidedly did not fit.  

Being an "edge case" isn't always about being marginalized -- but it *is* always about a failure of imagination.  Frequently someone wants to know one thing and then asks about a different, possibly correlated thing that they imagine is the same thing.  In the "what grade are you in?" example, people tied the question of "how old are you?" to "what level are you at in school?" in a way that's completely nonsensical to anyone outside the traditional school system.  Another example: tying "you are a person who has periods and wants to know when they are" to "you identify as a woman, and like the color pink, and care about your fertility" (period apps need to Stop).  

But at least a human person is someone to whom you can explain "I'm homeschooled, and I'm not in a specific grade because I am at different academic levels in different subjects, but if you wanted to know my age, I am X years old".  When you're asked these questions by a computer or a form, you have very little choice but to cut off pieces of yourself in order to [be more legible](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/).  

This isn't okay.  As a designer, it's your job to treat all of the people who interact with your designs humanely and with respect.  You want them to feel good after interacting with your designs.  If I as a nonbinary person need to label myself as either "Mr." or "Mrs." in order to download software I need for my job, I just feel ground down.  

This post makes a general point, but one of the places where I most often see design for edge-case users ignored is in accessibility.  Discord is still apparently totally unusable if you're blind and use a screen reader.  Most podcasts and videos, even those produced by major media, do not have transcripts or subtitles, so users who are deaf/hard of hearing/have auditory processing disorder/hell, have broken speakers on their computer are excluded.  Accessibility is an afterthought -- you run your website through accessibility testing software real quick, or maybe you don't, but it's fine, right?  Move fast, break things, launch first, make sure it actually works for everyone later, right?  

which sounds like

"Nobody (who matters) will care, right?"

which sounds like

"Edge cases don't matter, right?"

and those of us who are marginalized are extremely familiar with "I've identified a group of people who don't matter," and the way it can lead to dire and even lethal consequences, but EVEN LEAVING THAT ASIDE --

Like it or not, the standard key size is 19mm, and you're stuck with it even more than you're stuck with QWERTY -- at least layout can be reprogrammed in software.

    * I'd like to append to this one the vast number of systems that have trouble dealing with trans people, whose deadnames can often still be their legal names, but who would prefer to be known in all situations by a different chosen name (calling all doctor's offices, please don't shout patients' deadnames out to the whole waiting room).  MIT solves this by letting students change their "administrative name" without legal name changes, but MIT Medical handles this poorly and in most cases will still deadname you (and automatically sends appointment text message reminders with your deadname in them).  
 * Don't have a link for this on hand, but please consider people who've recently lost their mothers and people who've cut off toxic or abusive mothers when writing cutesy Mother's Day email copy.  Not everyone has a good relationship with their mother and wants to "get her something nice".
