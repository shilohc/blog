[A neural network can identify you by your typing style](https://gradtype.darksi.de/).  I played around with this for a while, and it consistently identified me when logged out even when I switched from a mechanical keyboard (GMMK TKL with gateron blue switches and DSA keycaps, for those interested) to the keyboard on my MacBook (circa 2016, and has a rubber cover on it -- very different typing experience and I feel I type a lot slower on it).  Fascinating and kind of terrifying from a browser-fingerprinting perspective.  

[A conspiracy to kill IE6](http://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6) -- exactly what it says on the tin.  A brief, incredible read.
