[This free crochet pattern](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/amigurumi-crab) for an amigurumi crab is one of the cutest little guys I've ever seen.  His little face is a delight!  So, of course, I've made three of them (one for me and two as gifts).  You'll need red (or other crab color) yarn, black yarn or embroidery floss for the smile, stuffing/fiberfill, and safety eyes (or you can just embroider your own eyes).  A tapestry needle will help with the joins, although you could do it all with just a crochet hook if stranded on a desert island.  Stitch markers help with following the pattern increases but aren't strictly necessary.

Usually I hate following patterns precisely, and typically make my own modifications; this crab is no exception.  Instead of real pincers, the original pattern just gives him vague club-like things -- which, like, c'mon, let him grab stuff!  So here's my pattern for the pincer:

> **Big claw:**
> 1. 6 sc in magic loop
> 2. 6 sc around
> 3. 2 sc in each of first 2 sc, sc in last 4 sc
> 4. 8 sc around
> 5. sc in first sc, 2 sc in each of next 2 sc, sc in last 5 sc
> 6. 10 sc around
> 7. sc in first 2 sc, sc2tog, sc in last 6 sc
> 8. sc in first sc, sc2tog, sc in last 5 sc
> 9. Break yarn & tie off
>
> **Small claw:**
>
> Same as big claw, but skip steps 5-7
>
> Sew together the two claws using the two stitches on each claw opposite the increases/decreases.  Stuff both claws, then SC around the 8 outside stitches (that is, excluding the two stitches from each claw that you've sewn together, but picking up all the other stitches around the outsides of the two claws) for five rounds.  Stuff, tuck all ends inside the claw, and attach to body as written in pattern.

(Let me know if this doesn't make any sense; I've never actually thought to take any pictures during this process.)

Now go forth, and make yourself an excellent lil crab fren with the best lil smile!
