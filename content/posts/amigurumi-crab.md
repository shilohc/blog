[This free crochet pattern](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/amigurumi-crab) for an amigurumi crab is one of the cutest little bastards I've ever seen.  His little face is A DELIGHT.  So of course I made my own.  You'll need yarn in two colors (red and black), fiberfill, and safety eyes (or you can just embroider your own eyes).  A tapestry needle will help with the joins, although you could do it all with just a crochet hook if stranded on a desert island.  Stitch markers help with following the pattern increases but aren't strictly necessary.  

I modified the pattern somewhat to give him real pincers instead of just vague club-like things (unusually, this is my only beef with this pattern).  When you're making the pincer, work from the tip up as written in the pattern, but do fewer increases and do them all on one side of the claw.  Before beginning the decreases, instead of working into the SCs on the "flat" side of the claw, ch 4 and skip 2 SCs.  Finish the claw as written by working into the chains, then go back and pick up stitches around the hole to make the smaller part of the pincer.  

Now go forth, and make yourself an excellent lil crab fren with the best lil smile.
