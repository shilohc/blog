[This article](https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-forms-96fadca0f49c) on form design seems perfectly innocuous.  It's a helpful guide that lays out best practices and briefly describes why they're better than the obvious alternative.  But then I got to this part:

> ### Why ask?  
> Omit optional fields and think of other ways to collect data.  Always ask yourself if the question can be inferred, postponed, or completely excluded.  

Okay, we're doing great so far.  The more unnecessary data you ask for, the more likely you are to violate your users' privacy, and incidentally the more likely you are to exclude "edge-case" users.  For example, Basler makes you fill out a brief biographical form in order to *download software for their cameras* -- name, address, and salutation (select exactly one of Mr. or Ms.) are all required fields.  No joy for nonbinary people (hi!  This really pissed me off!) or people with doctorates.  I am never going to let this one go, because I was essentially forced to misgender myself to do my job correctly (worked at an otherwise fantastic internship that used Basler cameras).  

> Data entry is increasingly automated.  For example, mobile and wearable devices collect large amounts of data without the user's conscious awareness.  Think of ways you can leverage social, conversational UI, SMS, email, voice, OCR, location, fingerprint, biometric, etc.

I DON'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT AT ALL.  

Soooo... what you're saying, essentially, is that instead of actually asking users for data you don't strictly need (so that they could leave it off the form if they don't want you to have it), you want designers to collect it by other means, "without the user's conscious awareness" if necessary??  Let me be clear: this is unethical.  Bad designer!  No cookie!  Consent is important for all things in life, including sex and collection of user data.
