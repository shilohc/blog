      <description>Last fall, I took 6.881 Intelligent Robot Manipulation (well, actually 6.881 is a &amp;ldquo;Special Subjects&amp;rdquo; course number, and when this course is offered again it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be renumbered, but that was the number I took it under).</description>

      <description>This free crochet pattern for an amigurumi crab is one of the cutest little guys I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. His little face is a delight! So, of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve made three of them (one for me and two as gifts).</description>

      <description>I did not set out in life to be an audiophile, but at some point in life you look around and realize that you&amp;rsquo;ve spent hundreds of dollars on headphones and developed strong opinions on their quality, and at that point it seems kind of silly to deny that you&amp;rsquo;re an audophile.</description>

      <description>I see so many videos on social media of robots (usually from Boston Dynamics), with a flood of comments along the lines of &amp;ldquo;haha wow can&amp;rsquo;t wait for this thing to kill us all&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently employed at my *checks notes* seventh internship, which God willing ought to be my last. Accordingly, I wanted to write up everything I know about internships, before I get employed full-time and forget it all.</description>

      <title>Criticizing design articles because I can</title>
      <link>https://shilohc.github.io/blog/posts/design_criticism_01/</link>

      <guid>https://shilohc.github.io/blog/posts/design_criticism_01/</guid>
      <description>This article on form design seems perfectly innocuous. It&amp;rsquo;s a helpful guide that lays out best practices and briefly describes why they&amp;rsquo;re better than the obvious alternative.</description>

      <title>That Fitbit rant</title>

      <description>While we&amp;rsquo;re at it, here&amp;rsquo;s another design rant that&amp;rsquo;s been percolating within me like a fine wine.
So, I have a Fitbit. Due to my chronic illness I need to keep an eye on my (unusually high) heart rate, which is why I originally bought the thing; it turns out to also be very useful for tracking my sleep.</description>

      <title>Design: Edge Cases and Legibility</title>
      <link>https://shilohc.github.io/blog/posts/design_legibility/</link>

      <description>From A Designer&amp;rsquo;s Code of Ethics:
 A designer does not believe in edge cases. When you decide who you’re designing for, you’re making an implicit statement about who you’re not designing for.</description>

      <title>Custom Keyboard Layout, Part 2</title>
      <link>https://shilohc.github.io/blog/posts/keyboard_layout_2/</link>

      <description>Okay, so my earlier post about modifying your keyboard layout sold you, but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to buy a whole new keyboard just yet? You want a software-side key remapping solution?</description>

      <title>Google Calendar Time Tracker</title>

      <description>The rest of this post was originally written in spring of 2019, when I&amp;rsquo;d just created the time tracker. In the interim, Google seems to have changed their auth flow, and I can no longer get the tracker to work &amp;ndash; not that I tried very hard, in all honesty.</description>

      <description>The humble blogroll seems to be much less popular these days than it was in the heyday of blogs, but I miss &amp;lsquo;em. Let&amp;rsquo;s bring this back.</description>

      <guid>https://shilohc.github.io/blog/posts/hnav/</guid>
      <description>The H-NAV is a LIDAR-based navigational aid for visually impaired people. The LIDAR detects obstacles within two meters that are approximately at face height, and a set of vibrating motors in the hatband indicates the obstacles&amp;rsquo; direction and rough distance.</description>

      <description>Sting Operation is a homebrew telepresence robot; my original intent was to use it to attend robot club when I&amp;rsquo;m away at MIT. Currently, it&amp;rsquo;s outfitted with a Neato BotVac LiDAR, a Raspberry Pi running ROS, and a PyBoard controlling the motors and LIDAR.</description>

      <description>This is a mechanical keyboard build (DZ60 PCB, Kailh Box Navy switches) that uses as its keycaps real keys from old typewriters.
I used three different sets of vintage typewriter keys.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Shiloh! I&amp;rsquo;m a robotics hobbyist turned &amp;ldquo;legitimate&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;engineer&amp;rdquo;, specializing in planning and control. Still, nobody can prevent me from building ill-advised hobby projects in my free time.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I&amp;rsquo;m massively obsessed with mechanical keyboards. For sheer customizability, they&amp;rsquo;re impossible to beat. Yes, I can put a lot of effort into software key remappings and then carefully port them over to every new computer I use &amp;ndash; or I can just use open-source keyboard firmware QMK and my keyboard will work wherever I plug it in.</description>
