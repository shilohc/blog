      <description>Last fall, I took 6.881 Intelligent Robot Manipulation (well, actually 6.881 is a &amp;ldquo;Special Subjects&amp;rdquo; course number, and when this course is offered again it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be renumbered, but that was the number I took it under).</description>

      <description>The rest of this post was originally written in spring of 2019, when I&amp;rsquo;d just created the time tracker. In the interim, Google seems to have changed their auth flow, and I can no longer get the tracker to work &amp;ndash; not that I tried very hard, in all honesty.</description>

      <description>The H-NAV is a LIDAR-based navigational aid for visually impaired people. The LIDAR detects obstacles within two meters that are approximately at face height, and a set of vibrating motors in the hatband indicates the obstacles&amp;rsquo; direction and rough distance.</description>

      <description>Sting Operation is a homebrew telepresence robot; my original intent was to use it to attend robot club when I&amp;rsquo;m away at MIT. Currently, it&amp;rsquo;s outfitted with a Neato BotVac LiDAR, a Raspberry Pi running ROS, and a PyBoard controlling the motors and LIDAR.</description>

      <description>This is a mechanical keyboard build (DZ60 PCB, Kailh Box Navy switches) that uses as its keycaps real keys from old typewriters.
I used three different sets of vintage typewriter keys.</description>
