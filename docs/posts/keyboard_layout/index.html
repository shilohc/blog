    </p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s no secret that I&rsquo;m massively obsessed with mechanical keyboards.  For sheer customizability, they&rsquo;re impossible to beat.  Yes, I can put a lot of effort into software key remappings and then carefully port them over to every new computer I use &ndash; or I can just use open-source keyboard firmware <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/">QMK</a> and my keyboard will work wherever I plug it in.  QMK also lets me program keys to do one thing when tapped and another thing when held down, or configure &ldquo;layers&rdquo; so that my letter keys will turn into symbol keys, so it&rsquo;s more powerful than software configuration.</p>
<p>How can I exercise this power for myself, I hear you ask?  First, get a keyboard that supports QMK.  I personally use a Preonic, which is not for everyone, but I recommend that you get a keyboard that has a split spacebar or otherwise has some extra thumb keys &ndash; these are very convenient to assign as &ldquo;layer activation&rdquo; keys.  Then, follow the <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs">QMK docs</a> on making a new keymap file and flashing your keyboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://shilohc.github.io/blog/img/preonic1.jpg" alt="The Preonic, with its original keycaps"></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that the Preonic has a &ldquo;lower&rdquo; key to the left of the spacebar and a &ldquo;raise&rdquo; key to the right.  These let you easily access &ldquo;raise&rdquo; and &ldquo;lower&rdquo; layers by holding down the respective key &ndash; instantly and enormously expanding your keyboard.  It also has actual, physical arrow keys, something that&rsquo;s important to me, and yet it takes up less space than a normal 60% keyboard.</p>
<p>The rest of this post will be about my personal layout choices.  You may want to follow along by looking at my personal config, which is <a href="https://github.com/shilohc/qmk_firmware/tree/shilohc/keymaps/keyboards/preonic/keymaps/shilohc">here</a>.  You can find all my personal QMK configs in my fork of QMK <a href="https://github.com/shilohc/qmk_firmware/tree/shilohc/keymaps">here</a>.  I also have a custom config for a DZ60, which is the PCB I used for my <a href="https://shilohc.github.io/blog/posts/typewriter_keyboard/">typewriter keyboard</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://shilohc.github.io/blog/img/preonic2.jpg" alt="The Preonic, with Tengwar DSA keycaps"></p>
<p>First, the default layer, labeled <code>_QWERTY</code> in <code>keymap.c</code>.  I haven&rsquo;t made too many changes here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete key changed to backslash because I write a lot of LaTeX and don&rsquo;t use delete.</li>
<li>Capslock changed to escape, something I highly recommend to all vim users.  If you use emacs I would instead suggest remapping it to ctrl.</li>
<li>The Enter key has been changed to <code>SFT_T(KC_ENT)</code>.  If it&rsquo;s held down, and another key is pressed, it functions as a shift; if tapped, it acts as enter.  This is because when I first switched to the Preonic I exclusively used the right shift key, which the Preonic doesn&rsquo;t have.  I now use the left shift more often on my preonic, but on my Macbook&rsquo;s rubber keyboard cover, there&rsquo;s still a massive wear spot in the right shift while the left shift is near-pristine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>_LOWER</code> layer is the one I&rsquo;ve customized the most &ndash; this is now my &ldquo;symbols and function keys&rdquo; layer.</p>
<ul>
<li>The symbols that usually live on the number keys, <code>!@#$%^&amp;*()</code>, have been moved to the top row of letters, and the other common programming symbols live on the home row.</li>
<li>All three sets of brackets (parentheses, square-brackets, and curlyboys) are in a vertical stack on the rightmost columns of letter keys.</li>
<li>Backslash stays the same, but pipe (<code>|</code>) has been moved to the quote key.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll notice that the little diagram in the comments says Squid on it.  I was experimenting with QMK&rsquo;s Unicode-sending functionality, something the USB HID device standard typically doesn&rsquo;t allow, by using this key to send the squid kaomoji, <code>くコ:彡</code>.  Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>_RAISE</code> layer is for special commands, since I moved all the symbol functionality into <code>_LOWER</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>H, J, K, L can be used to drive the mouse around, and the semicolon key sends a click.  U and I scroll down and up.  This is probably the functionality on this layer I use most often.</li>
<li>I experimented with using several other keys on this layer to control brightness, music, etc., but honestly I mostly don&rsquo;t use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s the <code>_ADJUST</code> layer, which I never use (except once, when I was randomly button-mashing and accidentally switched into Colemak).  The less said about this, the better.</p>
<p><img src="https://shilohc.github.io/blog/img/preonic3.jpg" alt="The Preonic, with Godspeed MT3 keycaps"></p>
<p>In the default keymap, both raise and lower have all the function keys on them, which is wasteful.  In addition, raise has a few symbols on it, in the same place where the lower layer also has symbols, which was really confusing for me to learn &ndash; I could never remember whether the symbol I wanted was on raise or lower.  And some of the symbols were just hard to reach, especially <code>~</code> and <code>|</code> which I type a lot in bash commands.  With all the symbols on the raise layer, the functionality is (mostly) neatly divided into &ldquo;symbols layer&rdquo; and &ldquo;not symbols layer&rdquo;, which is easier to remember.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve chosen to stick to the QWERTY layout rather than switch to Dvorak or Colemak or Workman or something, mostly because I use vim and don&rsquo;t want to disrupt that muscle memory.  (One afternoon I decided to try out Dvorak &ndash; my typing speed after a few hours of practice wasn&rsquo;t terrible, but then I tried to edit something in vim and I went directly to hell.  It was like, things are happening!  Why have I just jumped to the start of the file and deleted a bunch of lines?  That&rsquo;s not what I wanted!)  I find that even with QWERTY, my Preonic represents a significant ergonomic improvement over a standard keyboard, since it&rsquo;s ortholinear and very compact, reducing the distance my fingers have to stretch &ndash; and my custom layout improves things more by putting all the symbols under the top two rows of letters.  Your mileage, of course, may vary.  A keyboard layout is a very personal thing, and I encourage you to experiment and customize yours until it perfectly fits you and your needs.</p>
