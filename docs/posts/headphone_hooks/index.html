    <p>I did not set out in life to be an audiophile, but at some point in life you look around and realize that you&rsquo;ve spent hundreds of dollars on headphones and developed strong opinions on their quality, and at that point it seems kind of silly to deny that you&rsquo;re an audophile.  So.</p>
<p>I have three main sets of headphones that I keep at my desk: Sennheiser HD 280 Pro, Bose QC35 ii, and Sennheiser HD 6XX (Massdrop edition).  These all have different characteristics and serve different purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the HD 280s are wired headphones* with very good passive sound attenuation, and I&rsquo;ve owned them for long enough that the original headband pad completely shredded, so it&rsquo;s been replaced with a crochet pad I made.  The earpads are also coming unglued but I&rsquo;m procrastinating on replacing them.  These were my daily driver headphones for walking around campus and doing work at my desk when my dorm was loud, which was a lot of the time (my dorm had other social properties that I liked enough for the noise to be worthwhile).  They clamp tightly to my head in such a way that I get headaches from prolonged use; glasses choice matters a lot for this (my current computer glasses frames were carefully selected to be as comfortable as possible for wearing headphones).  This tight clamping gives them better isolation properties.</li>
<li>the Bose headphones are wireless noise-canceling headphones.  I wear these when there&rsquo;s a lot of environmental noise and the HD 280s don&rsquo;t quite cut it.  I don&rsquo;t like to wear wireless headphones when I can avoid it, but admittedly they are a lot better for walking around campus with (the HD 280s have this incredibly long and inconvenient cable and I developed a habit of spinning it around, which was probably dangerous/annoying for other hallway users).</li>
<li>the HD 6XX are my most recent headphone purchase, because I realized I had like $60 in Massdrop credits due to delayed keycap sets** and wanted to get myself a nice graduation/birthday present.  They are open-back headphones, because my new apartment is generally pretty quiet, and this bothers me less than noise canceling/attenuation for prolonged periods of time.  It&rsquo;s also nice to be able to hear my roommates when they&rsquo;re yelling for me.  These are my new daily driver headphones for doing work.  Open-back headphones also theoretically sound nicer/more &ldquo;open&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I only have the one set of ears, so the headphones not in use have to go <em>somewhere</em>.  Previously, I was keeping all of these headphones piled up on a table near my desk.  This was annoying, and made it hard to put other things on the table; they&rsquo;d also always end up on top of other items I keep on that table, like my stapler and tape dispenser.  Since headphones are sort of a funky shape, the common solution to the problem of headphone storage is the headphone hook, which is typically a cheap plastic hook with a sticky backing that you glue onto your desk somewhere.  I had a headphone hook stuck to my desk in my old dorm room, and it was ugly and felt a bit flimsy, especially since I kept piling multiple sets of headphones onto it.  Due to the furniture geometry, it also got in the way when I was moving out and had to pull my bookshelf away from the wall to rescue some stuff that fell behind it.</p>
<p>Therefore, my new headphone hook solution was to buy three foldable wall-mount aluminum clothes hooks and a roll of double-sided VHB tape.  The set of three hooks cost ~$10 and the tape roll was 16ft for ~$20.  Of course, I didn&rsquo;t use anywhere near the whole roll; I have practically the whole thing left for future endeavors to perma-stick things to other things.  In my new room geometry, there are no pieces of furniture being blocked by these hooks, but they&rsquo;re foldable anyway so I can easily get them out of the way if that changes.  The hooks are stuck to the side of my loft bed ladder in a visually pleasing vertical line, which makes them all easy to access.  They&rsquo;re also close enough to my laptop that I can leave the headphones plugged in while hanging them on the hook and the cable doesn&rsquo;t get in the way of anything else.  I&rsquo;m very pleased with this solution.</p>

<p><em>I wrote the first draft of this post on Jun 8.  I&rsquo;ve been using these hooks for a good few weeks now, and they&rsquo;re great.  Unfortunately, this didn&rsquo;t solve the perpetual-table-clutter problem, but at least the clutter is made of other stuff now &ndash; progress?</em></p>
<hr>
<p>* I am never sure how to deal with plural &ldquo;headphones&rdquo; grammatically.  the HD 280s are?  the HD 280 is a headphones?  the HD 280 is a headphone?</p>
<p>** Group-buy keycap sets are inevitably delayed.  Massdrop being an experienced group-buy manager, sometimes they do in fact deliver things on time, but I am a big fan of SA profile keycaps, and the SA production line has been very backed up lately.  And Massdrop gives me a $10 credit every time.  <code>&gt;:)</code></p>
